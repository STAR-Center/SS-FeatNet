## Customized TF Operators
This folder contains customized Tensorflow operations from [PointNet++](https://github.com/charlesq34/pointnet2) (Qi et al, NIPS2017).

Feat3D-Net uses the sampling and grouping layers in PointNet++ for the cluster sampling.

Before using, the TF ops need to be compiled, see the main Readme.md file.
